My work was presented at the recently concluded `IEEE SSP2012 (Michigan) <//www.eecs.umich.edu/ssp2012/>`__. It was a `poster <http://sauravtuladhar.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/noiseeigenpdf_tuladharbuckwage.pdf>`__  titled **Approximate Eigenvalue Distribution of a Cylindrically Isotropic Noise Sample Covariance Matrix**. This work was done in collaboration with my adviser Prof. John R. Buck and  Prof. Kathleen E. Wage from GMU.

Unfortunately, due to my internship commitments I wasn't able to attend the actual conference. My adviser presented the poster on my behalf.
